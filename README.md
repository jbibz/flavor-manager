* This project is to create, deploy, and update this CRM application built for the specific needs of my small [seasoning company](https://flavorjunkie.co).  
The goal was to deploy this repository on my homelab server so I can deploy, edit, pull, and monitor the application. It is a vibe-coded CRM for my small seasoning company. I built it around the needs I had when searching for a CRM and couldn’t find one that met them.
